# 3D Procedural Grass (Threejs)
This script renders grass in real time 3D generated procedurally using Perlin Noise. Animated using bezier function. 

## What it is:
* A dynamic grass simulation with instanced geometry and custom shaders.
* A spherical ground plane with noise-based height variations.
* A sky background with a sun simulation.
* User controls for camera movement and interaction.
* GUI controls for adjusting sun position and noise texture.

## Commercial Development:
Commercial implementation or further development based on varied use cases is possible. 
Please contact neela@craftpixels.in 

## Features:
* Grass blades are instanced for performance and animated with wind effects.
* The ground plane is bent into a sphere and textured with noise.
* The sun's position dynamically affects lighting and shadows.


## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
2. python -m http.server

## Acknowledgment
Inspired by Ghost of Tsushima's beautiful beautiful meadows and lush grass fields the game renders in realtime. Thanks to SimonDev for the case study.
